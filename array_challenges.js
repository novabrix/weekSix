  Task 1: Movie Titles and Ratings 🎥 (`.map`)
  
  Your manager asks you to display a list of all movie titles and their ratings 
  for a promotional email campaign.
  
  Steps:
  1. Use `.map` to create a new array where each item is a string in this format:
     "[title] - Rating: [rating]/10"
  2. Log the resulting array.
  
  Expected Output:
  [
    "Fast & Furious 10 - Rating: 7.5/10",
    "The Notebook - Rating: 8.0/10",
    "Spider-Man: No Way Home - Rating: 8.7/10",
    "Superbad - Rating: 7.0/10",
    "The Dark Knight - Rating: 9.0/10",
    "The Intern - Rating: 7.4/10"

  Your customers have requested a list of **highly rated movies**

  Expected Output:
  [
    { title: "The Notebook", genre: "Drama", rating: 8.0, rented: false },
